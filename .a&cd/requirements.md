## Requirements

### Default Behavior

The default behavior after package code is initialized is as follows:

- On mobiles, when a mobile user taps on `abbr` tags presented on the page the `title` attribute value appears near the `abbr` tag.
- The value disappears when a user taps beyond an `abbr` tag.
- The look and feel of the `title` value copies that of the desktop-native `abbr` `title`.
